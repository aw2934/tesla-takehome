# Project Details

The left pane (on a larger-screen device -- it's on top on mobile) allows the user to select the number of batteries desired. As the number increases, a few things happen:

1. The number of transformers changes, with one transformer for every four batteries
2. The Totals section updates accordingly
3. The autogenerated site layout pane populates with a representation of the site

Hovering over items in the site layout pane reveals a tooltip that provides info on the battery a particular item represents.

Quantity of each device is limited to 1,000 to prevent stack overflow at high numbers (although much higher than 1,000 is possible).
